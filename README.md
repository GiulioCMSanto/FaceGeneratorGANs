## Celebrities Face Generator
---
This project was carried out as a requirement of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Program. The main idea of the project is to build an application that is able to generate new images of faces from celebrities.

The project explores Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs).
